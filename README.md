<p>
Working Tickets
<p>
We will be working on a ticket's lifecycle, obviously these aren't real scenarios, but we will be able to work with the system's flow. 
<p>
We can create a ticket as an end user, Karen.

<p>
We can login as John, one of the agents and work on the ticket. 

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31f619f8-5ab4-4ea6-bf15-3c64dbde8f9d)
<p>
We can see the ticket, there is some info that is shown to us, such as the end user who submiited it, their contact info, etc.

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb8a2b96-538d-4c6f-bb03-c62abd1ba791)
<p>
We can make updates to the ticket, set the severance of the SLA. 

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53ea21cb-0707-4e82-8b53-a8fa73d91af1)
<p>
We can work on the ticket, add comments, send communications to the end user, assign it to other agents. 

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/757b246d-e71e-4747-9f77-f9c69b230772)
<p>
We ended up logging in as Jane now, as she has access to any capability in the ticketing system, we can let the end user know the update and resolution of her ticket. 

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02f7df3f-07a7-4872-8a8a-bbbf336d5fec)
<p>
We can close the ticket out and add a note, any important detials we might want to include. 

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beee1066-8b22-4dcd-b2a8-562180f15b1b)
<p>
Now the ticket is done, Obviously this is just an example, there can be many ways to resolve the issues, we can contact the end user, reach out to someone in another department, etc, but we were able to see how the osTicket system is able to work.
